Description: Synthetic Lethality is a relationship between two genes in a cell for which simultaneous inhibition of both genes
  leads to cell death when inhibition of zero or one genes leaves cells viable. The concept of synthetic lethality is a promising
  avenue for identification of biomarkers of drug sensitivity - specifically expression of genes that are synthetically lethal
  with the drug target. This package builds on the method developed in SELECT (Synthetic lethality-mediated precision oncology 
  Lee 2021) to assess the utility of synthetic lethality as a biomarker and implement methods for applying such a network.
